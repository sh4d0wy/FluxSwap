# 1inch Fusion+ x TON Cross-Chain Swap

This project implements a cross-chain swap solution between Ethereum and TON using 1inch Fusion+. It enables atomic swaps between the two blockchains while preserving hashlock and timelock functionality.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Atomic swaps between Ethereum and NEAR
- **1inch Fusion+ Integration**: Leverages 1inch's Fusion mode for order matching
- **Shade Agent Framework**: Decentralized solver network on NEAR
- **TEE Support**: Secure execution environment for the NEAR solver
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and maintain

## Prerequisites

### System Dependencies

```bash
# Install Node.js (v18+)
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Install pnpm
npm install -g pnpm

# Install Foundry (for Ethereum development)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Install Rust (for NEAR development)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Install NEAR CLI
npm install -g near-cli

# Install cargo-near
cargo install cargo-near
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-resolver-example.git
cd cross-chain-resolver-example
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
pnpm install

# Install Foundry dependencies
forge install
```

### 3. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Ethereum Configuration
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://eth.merkle.io
ETHEREUM_CHAIN_ID=1  # 1 for mainnet, 5 for Goerli, etc.

# NEAR Configuration
NEAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEAR_NODE_URL=https://rpc.testnet.near.org
NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account.testnet
NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:...

# Relayer Configuration
RELAYER_POLL_INTERVAL=5000  # 5 seconds
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## NEAR Solver Setup

The NEAR solver is implemented in Rust and runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

### Build the Solver

```bash
cd near-solver
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Deploy to Testnet

1. Log in to your NEAR account:
   ```bash
   near login
   ```

2. Deploy the solver:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh your-account.testnet
   ```

## Relayer Setup

The relayer handles cross-chain communication between Ethereum and NEAR.

### Start the Relayer

```bash
cd relayer
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

The relayer will start and begin monitoring for cross-chain events.

## Development Tools

### Ethereum Development
- Hardhat: Smart contract development and testing
- Foundry: Advanced testing and deployment
- Ethers.js: Ethereum interaction library

### NEAR Development
- NEAR CLI: For deployment and interaction
- cargo-near: For building and testing NEAR contracts
- near-cli-rs: Enhanced CLI experience (optional)

### Monitoring
- Prometheus: Metrics collection
- Grafana: Monitoring dashboards

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
# Run Ethereum tests
cd contracts
pnpm test

# Run NEAR solver tests
cd ../near-solver
cargo test

# Run relayer tests
cd ../relayer
pnpm test
```

### Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Start local Ethereum node (Anvil)
anvil

# In a new terminal, deploy contracts
cd contracts
pnpm deploy:local

# In another terminal, run integration tests
pnpm test:integration
```

## Development Workflow

### Ethereum Development
1. Write and test Solidity contracts in `contracts/src/`
2. Run tests: `pnpm test`
3. Deploy to testnet: `pnpm deploy:testnet`

### NEAR Development
1. Write and test Rust contracts in `near-solver/src/`
2. Run tests: `cargo test`
3. Deploy to testnet: `./deploy.sh your-account.testnet`

### Integration Testing
1. Start local Ethereum node: `anvil`
2. Deploy contracts: `pnpm deploy:local`
3. Start relayer: `cd relayer && pnpm start`
4. Run integration tests: `pnpm test:integration`

## Local Development

### Ethereum Local Node

```bash
# Start Anvil (local Ethereum node)
anvil

# Deploy contracts to local node
cd contracts
pnpm deploy:local
```

### NEAR Local Node

```bash
# Start NEAR local testnet
nearup run testnet

# Set NEAR_ENV to local
# export NEAR_ENV=local
```

## Available Scripts

### Contracts
```bash
# Compile contracts
pnpm compile

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Deploy to testnet
pnpm deploy:testnet

# Start local node
pnpm node
```

### NEAR Solver
```bash
# Build the contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Deploy to testnet
./deploy.sh your-account.testnet
```

### Relayer
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build
pnpm build

# Start
pnpm start
```

## IDE Setup

### VS Code Extensions
- Solidity (by Juan Blanco)
- Rust Analyzer
- Hardhat
- ESLint
- Prettier
- TOML Language Support
- Docker

### Recommended Settings

```json
{
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory": "contracts/src",
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory": "contracts/lib",
  "rust-analyzer.check.command": "clippy",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Testnet**
   - Deploy contracts to Ethereum testnet
   - Deploy NEAR solver to testnet
   - Configure and start the relayer

2. **Testing**
   - Run unit tests for all components
   - Test cross-chain swaps on testnet
   - Perform security audits

3. **Mainnet Deployment**
   - Deploy audited contracts to mainnet
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Deploy production relayer infrastructure

## Security Considerations

- Always audit smart contracts before deployment
- Use multi-sig wallets for contract administration
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Keep private keys secure
- Regularly update dependencies

## Running

To run tests you need to provide fork urls for Ethereum and Bsc

```shell
SRC_CHAIN_RPC=ETH_FORK_URL DST_CHAIN_RPC=BNB_FORK_URL pnpm test
```
